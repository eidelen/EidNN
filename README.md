# EidNN
Neural Network C++ implementation.

This project is about implementation-from-scratch fun and becoming familiar with neural networks and deep learning.

EidNN is written in C++11 and uses Eigen3 for vector / matrix arithmetic. Tests are written with Google's gtest. CMake is used as build environment.

# Example
Classification of handwritten digits - MNIST database.
